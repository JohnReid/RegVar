,"Table S1. PMCA measures for candidate SNPs at eight T2D susceptibility loci included into the proof of concept analysis. Related to Figure 1. Details on PMCA measures and scoring criteria are given in Figure 1 and in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Loci are ordered by chromosome and genomic position (NCBI GRCh37/hg19). The tagSNP, the reported gene locus and the corresponding reference (Ref) are listed. For each tagSNP, LD blocks were defined using the 1000 Genomes Pilot 1 CEU data (The 1000 Genomes Consortium, 2010) (r2 ≥ 0.7, distance limit 500 kb). Measures of pair-wise LD (r2 and D') between the GWAS tagSNP and the proxy SNPs are calculated using the SNAP viewer tool (Johnson et al., 2008), Broad Institute. The risk allele frequency, the type of SNPs and the nearest gene information were derived from SNAP viewer data. PMCA measures Supplemental Experimental Procedures) are shown for the respective genomic region of each proxy SNP. The counts of phylogenetically conserved TFBS, modules and TFBS_in_modules and the respective estimations of random occurrence (p-est) are given for both, the complete set of input sequences (ΩTFBS, Ωmodules, ΩTFBS_in_modules and p-estTFBS, p-estmodules, p-estTFBS_in_modules) and the restricted set of input sequences (Ωrestr-TFBS, Ωrestr-modules, Ωrestr-TFBS_in_modules and p-estrestr-TFBS, p-estrestr-modules, p-estrestr-TFBS_in_modules); overall scores are given for the complete set of input sequences (Sall) and the restricted set of input sequences (Srestr-all). SNP regions with Sall > 6.5, p-estTFBS < 0.075 and p-estrestr-TFBS < 0.15 were assigned as complex regions. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
